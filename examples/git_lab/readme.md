# Git Lab Example

This is a complete example grader for a git lab. The hypothetical lab is meant to teach basic git setup and usage. It has 4 requirements for students:

1. The student must install git and have it available at the command line
1. The student must initialize git in a directory
1. The student must make at least 3 commits in that repository
1. The student must push the repository to github and have it publicly accessible

We will write out these criteria in a rubric in the `rubrics/main.yml` file. Then we'll write the associated tests in `src/tests.rs` and configure the rest of the process in `src/main.rs`. We will also set up a dropbox to accept the submissions.
