# Lab Grader

[Repository](https://github.com/llamicron/lab_grader) | [Documentation](https://docs.rs/crate/lab_grader)

This is a Rust package that automates a lot of the necessary steps for grading labs in technology management classes. It is intended for use at Texas A&M University's TCMG classes, but anyone can use it. This is not an official TAMU application.

This package will provide a framework, but the user must provide the criteria. This way, a lot of the boiler plate is reduced and the user can focus only on what is relevant to grading the assignment.

If you are using this for a public institution, please familiarize yourself with FERPA guidelines. This application will generate grades attached to students names/ID numbers. This information may need to be kept private.
